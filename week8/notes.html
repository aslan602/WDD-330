            The "transform" property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.
            The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top.
            The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.
            The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.
            The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis.
            Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.
            The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.
            The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.
            The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.
            Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins.

            It is possible to draw with the help of the Canvas API.
            You can draw shapes with line colors and fill colors.

            A user can also draw with SVG which stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
            It uses XML to draw with and does not need a backdrop like Canvas.

            Elements on a page can be made dragable and dropable by the DOM.
