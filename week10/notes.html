           Validation
           
           The two sides of validation are the client-side validation and the server-side validation.
           The 5 types of client-side validation are"
                1. A Required entry 
                2. A minLength or manLength of a string. 
                3. min and max of numbers. 
                4. Make sure the "type" of data is correct.
                5. A pattern is in the data (using regular expression)
            
            The Constraint Validation API will use JavaScript to valid input from forms.  There is a list of validations it can check.  Click the link below to see:

            Fetch

            Fetch is used to get information from the HTTP Pipeline.
            It will not stop if there is an error. A status of "ok" can be used if values are from 200-299.
            A fetch returns a promise.  For the simplest code of a fetch statement, see example 1 in code. 
            THe reponse is an object. EX: response.ok  It can also be a interger or string value.
            Data can be sent or asked for through fetch(). Can send a file or multiple files.  Can send JSON data. Can even process a text file line by line.
            To see examples and more information, see the webpage:
