            There are 3 types of errors.  System Errors, Programming Errors, and User Errors.
            An Exception is error that produces a return value that the program can deal with.
            A Stack Trace is a line of exception to led to where the error occured.
            A Warning is an error that isnt big enough to cause the program to crash.
            Strict Mode is a way to make old code and practices come accross as errors.  This makes the code more modern and correct.
            To use Strict Mode in Javascript, just type 'use strict'. 
            Linting Tools are programs that help you write better code by showing errors and bad practices.  They can be a plug in in an IDE to show bad code as it is written.
            If a feature might noit be supported by a browser, put it in an if statement.  See code example 1. This way it will not throw an exception, it will just come back as undefined.
            You can put a breakpoint in the code by using alert.  The user has to hit ok to continue, so it stops the execution of the code. 
            You can use console.log() to see values in the code. 
            The keyword debugger can be used to set up break points and see values in variable by hovering over them.
            There are 7 differnt types of error objects.  They are :
            EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.            
            RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.
            ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn’t been defined.
            SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.
            TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.
            URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.
            InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in+ the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this is too much recursion.
            The throw keyword will halt the program by throwing an exception.  The throw keyword can be placed anywhere in Javascript.  See code example 2.
            Use try and catch of error handling.
            TDD or Test Driven Development is writing a test first, then writing the code for that test. 
            Jest is a program for TDD framework used by FaceBook.  It is popular.
