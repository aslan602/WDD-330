        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        <pre>In Chapter 2 of Novice to Ninja, we learn of Template Literals
            which use the backtick character like so:
             'Hello!';
             This allows interpolation in Javascript:
             'Hello ${ name }!';
             If name = 'Siri'; then the result would be  Hello Siri!
             
             Symbol is a new data type:
             const id = Symbol('This is a ID');
             The main use-case for symbols is as object property keys.
             
             Infinity and -Infinity represent value that are bigger or small than 
             the range that Javascript can handle.

             Number.isFinite(arugement) return true if it is a number in range (not Infinity).
             EX: Number.isFinite(43)
             true

             In Chapter 3, Destruring is able to swap variable value without using a temp variable.
             EX: [x, y] = [y, x] (x=1 and y=2 but now x=2 and y=1)

             join() changes an array by turning all values to strings and seperating them with a
             comma. If join(' & ') is used then they will be seperated by the arguement.
             EX: avenger.join(' & ')  'Captain America & Iron Man & Thor'

             In chapter 4, we can declare a function with '=>' (same as a pointer in C++)
             EX: const add = (x,y) => x + y;
