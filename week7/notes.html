        The call() method can use a variable to insert the variable into a nother function that uses the 'this' keyword.  See Example 1.
        If using the call methos without this, the first argument has to be null.  See Example 2.
        An iffy function is a function that has () around.  This keeps all variables local to that function.  See Example 3.
        The wait() method allows asynchronously functions to be called.  It takes 3 arguments. (message, callback, seconds.) See Example 4.
        A promise is a function to do callback functions in an orderly way.  A promise is made and results are either sucess or failure.  THe promise function will wait for the results.  See Example 5.
