            "This" is used to access information from a object during runtime.  In JavaScript, "this" keyword does not have to be accociated with an object. 
            To create an object, just use {}.  A method is a function in an object. Seperate methods in an object with a comma.
            The "in" operator can be used to check if a value exists in an object. EX: 'city' in superman.  It will return a boolean.
            It is possible to nest objects.
            Naming Parameters lets you add arugument just like an object.  Can even assign values in the argument.  
            Namespace is a way to prevent using the same function name is a program or library.  Just put the function inside an object!
            Regular expresion can be use with an object regExp().  The exec() and text() methods can be used to finfd the answers for the expression.
            Matched Groups can be used by () in RegExp and put in an array.  See example in "code.html"

            "DOM" stands for Document Object Model
            DOM started in 1998. 
            Different parts of a document are called nodes and have a number attached to them.  nodeType gices 1=element, 2=attribute, 3=text, 8=comment 9="body"
            nodeName will also name the part of the document.
            CSS querySelector is a different way to find very specific information.  It is also how jquery works. EX: 
            const ul = document.querySelector('ul#roster');
            ul.querySelector('li#bats')
            The DOM is set=up like a tree.  There is a parent node, childnodes, siblingnodes, and so forth. 
            You can use getters and setter with the classes and nodes.
            The toggle method can add or subtract a class if there is one that exists or not. See "code" for example.
            The DOM can create conent using createElement and createTextNode. Could also use textContennt.
            Other methods include appendChild, insertBefore, removeChild, and replaceChild.

            Events are something that happens when a user clicks on something.
            addEventListener() is the right way to add an event.
            Parameter agruements are 1.event 2.callback function 3.capture or not (bool)
            To see wher a click happened from lft and top in pixels, use screenX or screenY, clientX or clientY, and/or pageX or pageY. This goes from screen, browser window
            to document.
            Remove event listeners by removeEventListener().
