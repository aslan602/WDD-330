        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <pre>       This week we learned how to save information to a devices hard drive.
        We use localStorage.setItem() to save information. The variables go 
        in the parentheses to pass whatever needs saving.
        To retrieve the information that was saved, we use localStorage.getItem().
        The parentheses gets filled with the variable you would like the information
        saved too.
