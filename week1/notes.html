        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <p>This week we learned how to save information to a devices hard drive.</p><br>
        <p>We use localStorage.setItem() to save information. The variables go </p><br>
        <p>in the parentheses to pass whatever needs saving.</p><br><br>
        <p>To retrieve the information that was saved, we use localStorage.getItem().</p><br>
        <p>The parentheses gets filled with the variable you would like the information</p><br>
        <p>saved too.</p>
