            The window object is a global object.  It is the browser the user is using.  Can get dimensions of the screen, pages visited, and current page information.
            THe window object is called the Browser Object Model or BOM for short.
            All code using globes should use the window object.  EX: x = 6;  window.x === x; (true)
            alert() is a window object .  Confirm() can do the same thing.  The promt() will ask for input.  All these methods stop execution.
